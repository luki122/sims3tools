Thank you for downloading s3pe - if you haven't, this program is not going to interest you..! :)

This tool is designed to be used as part of s3pe's Helper system.

After installing the tool, please place the .helper files from the Helpers folder
into the Helpers folder of your s3pe installation.  You may need to open them in a text editor
to check and amend the paths contained - which should be the paths to this application.
For most people who accepted all the default locations when installing, you will not need to edit them.

The tool enables exchange of meshes between the MLOD and MODL resources of an object and
Blender (using cmomoney's plug-ins).  The file format used for exchange was originally created by Wes.
